# Galamsay Analysis API Project

This project analyzes dataset on illegal small-scale mining activities (Galamsay) in Ghana and exposes the results via a RESTful API. The API calculates the following: 

- Total number of Galamsay sites across all cities. 
- Region with the highest number of Galamsay sites.
- List cities where the Galamsay sites exceed a given threshold (e.g 10).
- Average number of Galamsay sites per region.
